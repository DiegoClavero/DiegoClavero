# Personal Info
Hi! I'm Diego Clavero, a solo dev and occasional game dev.

I have been programming since I was four-five years old, so I could say I have some experience.

Spain is an beautiful country, you should definitely come visit me! <img src="spain.png" alt="Spain" style="float:none;width:16px;height:16px;"/> <img src="spain.png" alt="Spain" style="float:none;width:16px;height:16px;"/>

# To-do list
Although I have completed most of my objectives, some are left to do, such as:

- Languages:
    - [ ] HTLM & CSS **(Very important)**
    - [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] End this list

New things will be added with the years, to hopefully end up completing them.
